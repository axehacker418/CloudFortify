# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running on Localhost

1.  Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
3.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4.  Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
5.  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server. This will usually start the app on `http://localhost:9002`.
